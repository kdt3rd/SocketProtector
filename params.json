{"body":"### Welcome to Socket Protector\r\n\r\nSocket Protector is a small daemon that makes it easy to make resilient network services.\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple, and not a new one. When starting on this, no prebuilt / production ready daemon could be found to do this. But the basic idea is to have a daemon who listens on a particular port and manages another sub-program. The incoming connection sockets are forwarded over a UNIX socket to the sub-process. This allows one to trigger a restart of your daemon without having to stop responding to connections, and allowing the existing connections to continue to be handled by the previous instance, but new connections handled by a new instance, providing a smoother upgrade path for your server without having to specially code for it.\r\n\r\nMore to come...","name":"Socket Protector","tagline":"shim daemon to isolate external network connections from running daemon","note":"Don't delete this file!
